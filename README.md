Inspired by [Nock](https://github.com/nock/nock), this library allows you to record and replay functions (usually libraries) in your jest tests. By doing so, you don't have to mock your dependencies while testing your code without relying on external services.

## Installation

npm i -S apollo-datasource-swr
```
